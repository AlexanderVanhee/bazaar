Bazaar is a new app store for GNOME with a focus on discovering and installing
apps and add-ons from Flatpak remotes, particularly
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/). The UX emphasizes supporting the developers who
make the Linux desktop possible. Bazaar features a "curated" tab that can be
configured by distributors.

Bazaar implements the gnome-shell search provider dbus interface. A krunner
[plugin](https://github.com/bazaar-org/krunner-bazaar) is available for use on
the KDE Plasma desktop.

Thanks to [Tobias Bernard](https://tobiasbernard.com/), [Jakub
Steiner](http://jimmac.eu), and [Sam Hewitt](https://snwh.org) for designing
Bazaar's market stall icon.

### Installing

Pre-built binaries are distributed via Flathub and GitHub actions:

[![Build Flatpak and Upload Artifact](https://github.com/bazaar-org/bazaar/actions/workflows/build-flatpak.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bazaar-org/bazaar/actions/workflows/build-flatpak.yml)

There also exist packages for [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bazaar)
and [Arch](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/bazaar/). These are not
directly supported but should work fine. If you encounter a bug on any package
of Bazaar other than the flatpak, ensure the bug also exists on the flatpak
before reporting it here.

### Supporting

If you would like to support me and the development of this app (Thank you!), I
have a ko-fi here! <https://ko-fi.com/kolunmi>

Thanks to everyone in the GNOME development community for creating such an
awesome desktop environment!
